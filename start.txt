INSTRUCTIONS: To "run" this text file, open up command prompt
    1. In this folder on windsows, hold down shift and right click in the folder
    2. Select open a powershell window in this folder (it might say command prompt window, sorry i have a mac)
    3. in the window that pops up, you can type commands
    4. type "cat start.txt" into the window, press enter, and it will print out this file in the window. If it doesn't work, try "type start.txt" or "print start.txt" idk man windows is weird. Worst case scenario, just film scrolling through? 
Everything below this is just dummy text but it will look good hopefully

[MESSAGE] I'd recommend downloading visual studio code, it's pretty lightweight and you can pick a cool theme in settings. Also put up https://github.com/achaltin/webseries_demo, and a command prompt window. Shit looks real.
[MESSAGE] If you want to "edit" this website, click the "columns" button, and pretend you're deciding on a column layout or not

[MESSAGE] You can also open up the all.css file, and in the part that looks like this:
     /*
        * You can change these numbers to adjust where the button that says Columns is!
    */
    #colButton{
    position: absolute;
    left: 565px;
    top: -53px;
    }
You can change the 565 or -53 to other values, but make sure the px is there
